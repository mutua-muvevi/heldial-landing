	competition: {
		title: "Our Competition",
		paragraph: [
			`The competitive environment and the upswing of local and national economies put us in an enviable position for the last two years in terms of the demand for convenience services and client custom/commercial coatings requirements. This created a positive competitive environment, as there were not enough service providers to satisfy the body of available work. Needless to say, time changes everything, the economic downswing as of late has put moderate competitive pressures on the painting services provider community at large, creating a developing environment of cutthroat pricing and job leverage.`,
			`It is our position that by changing our mix of business, competitive client pursuit, and pricing practices we have been able to remain competitive and most importantly growing. Heldial competes on service and price. We gather market-based information on an ongoing basis and develop our pricing and cost strategies based on market norms specific to our client profile and geographic considerations.`,
			`Our competitors range from the small independent 1-2 man painting service for residential and light commercial work to the medium-size 10-20 man commercial-only shops. To find out who to beat and who’s getting the work, we need not look further than the local Yellow Pages and more importantly, by having those tough discussions with our client prospects that select another provider and asking them “Why weren’t we chosen?”`,
			`We have found that dealing with reality and modifying our tactics with reality has helped us keep an edge when it comes to beating the competition.`,
			`On any given day, in our particular market segment we have to keep an eye out for an average of 10-15 competitors in our market, particularly in the commercial and municipal service sector.`,
